# Ruby API Client For IONOS Cloud Certificate Manager

IonoscloudCertificateManager - the Ruby gem for the Certificate Manager API

Using the Certificate Manager Service, you can conveniently provision and manage SSL certificates with IONOS services and your internal connected resources. For the [Application Load Balancer](https://api.ionos.com/docs/cloud/v6/#Application-Load-Balancers-get-datacenters-datacenterId-applicationloadbalancers), you usually need a certificate to encrypt your HTTPS traffic. The service provides the basic functions of uploading and deleting your certificates for this purpose.
